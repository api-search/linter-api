  name: Read Documentation
  description: >-
    We provide separate interactive documentation for each of the API.io APIs, but the search API is probably the one you are interested in using, unless you are a partner and have contacted us about the verified plan.

  name: Generate GitHub Developer Token
  description: >-
    To obtain a token, just head over to your [GitHub settings and generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) within minimal viable access to your GitHub profile--which we will then verify and add as API key for the APIs.io API.

- step: 5
  name: Try API With Your Token
  description: >-
    The documentation for each APIs.io API has a try it out function where you can put your API token in and begin making calls to the  API. You will be able to make up to 500 calls per day using your token, and if you need more you can contact us about bumping up to the verified plan.

  name: Download SDK of Your Choice
  description: >-
    If you are needing to integrate the API into an application you can download one of our SDKs in the programming language of your choice. If there is a platform or language that is not available, make sure to let us know so we can see if you can make it happen.
